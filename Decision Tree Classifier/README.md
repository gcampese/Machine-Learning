# Decision Tree Classification

This project utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier to classify whether or not an individual buys a computer (the class being yes or no) based on several features (age, income, student, and credit rating). A Decision Tree Classifier is constructed both in Python and by hand. These two methods are then compared at the end of the Python Notebook.
